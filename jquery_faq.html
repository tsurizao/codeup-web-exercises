                A:
                Vehicles, and vehicle combinations, longer than 21 feet (including bumpers) or wider than 8 feet
                (including
                mirrors) are prohibited between Avalanche Campground and the Sun Point parking area. You may however,
                drive
                to Avalanche if traveling east, and to Sun Point, if traveling west. Vehicles over 10 feet in height may
                have difficulty driving west from Logan Pass due to rock overhangs. Stock trucks and trailers may access
                Packers Roost and Siyeh Bend.
